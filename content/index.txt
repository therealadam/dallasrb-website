h3. Ruby at the Dallas Morning News

Learn how Ruby and Rails are influencing the world of journalism. Across the journalism world, Python/Django and Ruby/Rails are changing the way we tell stories to the public. Also, I'll discuss the way Ruby influences our everyday journalism needs with some real world examples. 

h3. Ryan McNeill

Ryan McNeill is the computer-assisted reporting editor at The Dallas Morning News. That's a fancy way of saying he heads data analysis for both short- and long-term stories at The News. McNeill isn't a computer scientist, but a journalist who learned Perl and then Ruby as a way to wrangle odd data sets. Learning Rails is an effort to find new ways to tell stories. Other geeky things we use in the newsroom: SPSS, ArcGIS, UCINet, SQL Server and MySQL --- all in the name of finding stories others don't.
