h3. Ruby on the Desktop(s)

You yawn when you read about static languages adding dynamic features and frameworks adding Rails-like functionality, but developing desktop applications in Ruby has peaked your interest. Real Ruby solutions are coming to both the Mac and the PC. We'll look at an application built with both MacRuby and IronRuby to show the state of Ruby on the desktop. We'll compare the platforms, the UI tools, and the pros and cons of using Ruby in these environments.

h3. B.J. Allen

B.J. Allen is currently an application developer at "RD2, Inc":http://rd2inc.com/, where he works mainly on .NET web and desktop applications for a wide variety clients. While primarily using C# at work, he also began using Ruby in 2006 and takes every opportunity to bring Ruby into his work day.
